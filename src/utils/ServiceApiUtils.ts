 * This class is designed to be stateless, offering static methods that can be
 * reused throughout the application without the need for instantiation.

     * Adjusts the request signal by applying a timeout and handling overrides.
     * This function modifies the request configuration by integrating a timeout signal.
     * @param initOverrides - Optional request initialization overrides.
     *                        This can be an object of type `RequestInit`
     *                        or a function that returns a modified `RequestInit`.
     * @param requestTimeoutInSeconds - The timeout duration in seconds for the request. Defaults to 25 seconds.
     * @returns A promise that resolves to a `RequestInit` object with the adjusted signal.
     * @throws Will throw an error if the request cannot be configured properly.
     *
     * @example
     * ```typescript
     * const resolvedInitOverrides = await adjustRequestSignal({ method: 'GET' }, 30);
     * console.log(resolvedInitOverrides.signal); // Output: AbortSignal with a timeout of 30 seconds
     * ```
